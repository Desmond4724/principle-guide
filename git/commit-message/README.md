# Write good commit message

Begin your message with a short summary of your changes (up to 50 characters as a guideline).
- Separate it from the following body by including a blank line.

### The body of your message should provide detailed answers to the following questions:
- What was the motivation for the change?
- How does it differ from the previous implementation?
 
Use the imperative, present tense („change“, not „changed“ or „changes“) to be consistent with generated messages from commands like git merge.

# Example 
- If applied, this commit will ```refactor subsystem X for readability```
- If applied, this commit will ```update getting started documentation```
- If applied, this commit will ```remove deprecated methods```
- If applied, this commit will ```release version 1.0.0```
- If applied, this commit will ```merge pull request #123 from user/branch```
