# Write good commit message

Begin your message with a short summary of your changes (up to 50 characters as a guideline). Separate it from the
following body by including a blank line. The body of your message should provide detailed answers to the following
questions: What was the motivation for the change? How does it differ from the previous implementation? Use the
imperative, present tense („change“, not „changed“ or „changes“) to be consistent with generated messages from commands
like git merge.
