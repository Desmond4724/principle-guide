# Single File component filename
- Filenames of single-file components should either be always PascalCase or always kebab-case [more](#user-content-filenames-of-single-file-components).
- Base components (a.k.a. presentational, dumb, or pure components) that apply app-specific styling and conventions should all begin with a specific prefix, such as Base, App, or V.
