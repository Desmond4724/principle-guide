# First task for a good component file name
- [Download init project](https://github.com/Desmond4724/principle-guide/raw/master/vue/component-name/tasks/1/init-project.zip)
- Unarchive zip
- Initialize the package manager by ```npm install``` if you are yarn ```yarn```
- Create a new repository if you do not have one on [Github](https://github.com) or [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com)
- Checkout to a new branch for this task
- Check the folder 'components' of the project
- In the 'components' folder, there are a number of files which are named in the wrong format. Find them and improve by this ([methodology](https://github.com/Desmond4724/principle-guide/tree/master/vue/component-name#filenames-example))
- Push the project
